# FamilyNeeds-excel-data-analysis
Family needs is a detailed Dashboard, product-driven analysis for NGO, built with clean UI and end-to-end Excel.

Family Needs required a comprehensive dashboard that could serve NGO managers, field officers, and donors. The dashboard had to present product-driven analysis with clarity while maintaining a professional and trustworthy tone. The design process focused on clean layouts, intuitive navigation, and user-friendly visualizations. I structured the Excel solution end-to-end, integrating data analysis, reporting, and automated updates, giving the team a reliable tool to track impact and support decision-making with minimal effort.
